//test exception
/* Causes an error by parsing a number that converts to the largest negative
 * number, then dividing by -1, causing a division exception.
 * Similar to the test provided, but reading the intel manual, there are
 * not really any ways we can trigger the division error, as we use 32 bit
 * source operands only, and so can only get errors related to the sign
 * mismatch.
