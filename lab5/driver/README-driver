This directory contains the driver files for testing your compiler.

Copy the driver files to the directory where your compiler is

$ cp driver/* compiler/
$ cp runtime/* compiler/

Now you can call the driver as in

$ cd compiler
$ ./driver.pl [options] [files ...]

For a complete list of options, pass driver.pl the -h flag; for more
documentation, run

$ perldoc driver.pl

As of Lab 5, this directory also contains the cycle timing infrastructure

$ ./timer.pl [options] [files ...]

The files set up in this manner are lab5/bench?/*.l4.  The interface is as follows:

void* init(int param);
void prepare(void* data, int param);
void run(void* data, int param);
void checksum(void* data, int param);

p = init(n) - initializes data structures for the problem instance with
              parameter n, default n = 1000.  Run once per benchmark.

prepare(p,n) - sets data structures to defined initial value
run(p,n)     - run test, with cycle counting

prepare(p,n); run(p,n) are iterated some number of times until we have
convergence to a good cycle count, but a maximum of 1000 iterations

checksum(p,n) - a checksum to validate result of a run
