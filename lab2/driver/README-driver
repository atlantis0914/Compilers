This directory contains the driver files for testing your compiler.

Copy the driver files to the directory where your compiler is

$ cp driver/* compiler/
$ cp runtime/* compiler/

Now you can call the driver as in

$ cd compiler
$ ./driver.pl [options] [files ...]

For a complete list of options, pass driver.pl the -h flag; for more
documentation, run

$ perldoc driver.pl
