This directory contains the files defining the link-time and run-time
environment for your generated assembly files.  The Autolab server
uses (almost) identical runtime files to grade your code upon hand-in.

We suggest you copy the runtime files to the directory where you are
are implementing your compiler.

% cp -p runtime/* compiler/

Now the driver can link the runtime with your generated
<file>.s, using the command

% gcc -m64 <file>.s l1rt.c

to generate the executable a.out, which it will then run and
test for the correct answer.
