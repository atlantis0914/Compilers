Lab 1 Handout

doc/       -- lab specification
driver/    -- driver files (almost) identical to those on Autolab
           -- test your copiler with
              % ./driver.pl file1.l1 file2.l1 ...
runtime/   -- runtime environment for generated assembly
           -- generate executable with
	      % gcc -m64 <testfile>.s l1rt.c

fsharp/    -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in F#
haskell/   -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in Haskell
java/      -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in Java
ocaml/     -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in OCaml
scala/     -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in Scala
sml/       -- starter code targeting pseudo assembly, in SML

-- do:
-- % svn copy <lang> compiler
-- to obtain a modifiable copy of the starter code in the compiler/
-- directory, where <lang> is one of the above

tests0/    -- some provided test files
tests1/    -- test files assembled from all group, shortly after week 1
tests2/    -- test files from prior semesters, shoftly after week 1

To be created (details see doc/lab1.pdf):

tests/     -- directory with your own test files *.l1
compiler/  -- directory with your own compiler
