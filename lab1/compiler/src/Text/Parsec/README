This is a modified version of parsec with the following additional
features:

* Generalize Line Comments: generalizes the line comment facility by
allowing you to use a parser instead of a string. The main purpose of
this is to allow parsing of languages which have multiple valid comment
indicators.

* Added multiple pre/postfix operator support
